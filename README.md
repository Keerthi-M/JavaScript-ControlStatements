# JavaScript-Control Statements
It explains problems that are solved using array and control statements of JavaScript such as loops and iterators.
<br>
### Description of the problems solved here using the concepts of Arrays and loops of JavaScript:
<h4> 1.Arrays </h4> 
Description:
Define a function which returns the output as per the required
datatype. The array should be passed to the function. Find the
product of cubes of the numeric vector using the while loop. Return
the result when it is not null. Otherwise, return “Array returned
null”.

Conditions:
1. Use a math object to get the result.
2. For loop is not allowed.

<h4> 2.Loops </h4>
Description:
Accept a number input and print a string output. Define a
function to perform the following operation. Insert dashes (-) between
two consecutive even numbers. Note that the function should return
the array or array-like object. For example if you accept 025468 the
output should be 0-254-6-8.

Conditions:
1. Javascript array methods must be used.
2. The data type should be declared as mentioned above.

<h4> 3.Iterators </h4>
Description:
Define a function which accepts an array . Calculate the product
of each value of the array with the given number and find the sum of
the products using the map method of the iterator.

Conditions:
1. Map method must be used.
2. The data types should be declared as mentioned above.
